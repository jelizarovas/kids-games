## Introduction

The Kids-Games Touch Helper is a personal project created to enhance the experience of young children playing educational games on touchscreen devices. Notably, it focuses on games available on [PBS](https://pbskids.org/sesame/games/), a reputable source of quality educational content. This project is born out of a simple necessity: to make these games more accessible and enjoyable for my 2-year-old, who, like many toddlers, struggles with the precision required for touchscreen interactions.

## Motivation

Touchscreen devices, while intuitive, can pose significant challenges for toddlers. My child's attempts to interact with PBS games often resulted in unintentional gestures, such as pinch zooms, right clicks, or exits from game modals, severely hindering the gameplay experience. The Kids-Games Touch Helper aims to mitigate these issues by providing a more forgiving interface that allows children to explore and play without the frustration of unintended inputs.

## Features

- Disable Pinch Zoom: Prevents accidental zooming, keeping the game's interface consistent.
- Block Right Click: Eliminates context menus from appearing during gameplay.
- Lock Game Modal: Ensures that games remain in focus, preventing accidental exits.

## Setup and Usage

The project is designed to be used on touch-enabled laptops and tablets, such as Google's Pixelbook and Microsoft's Surface Studio. Detailed instructions on setting up and deploying the Kids-Games Touch Helper will be provided to ensure a smooth and straightforward experience.
